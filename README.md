# Bank tech Test

### Brief:
Create a model of a bank account with whichÂ the user can interact to make deposits, withdrawals, view their balance (not in spec but I thought it'd be nice) or print their account statement.

#### Techniques practiced:
* OOP
* TDD

* Using Ruby version 2.4.0

### Testing:

Since this is a relatively simple program with only one class (bank_account), I have put all the tests in the same file.
They're split into context blocks which cover the different behaviours of the class.

Enter 'rspec' on the command line to run the suite of tests.

### Running the program:

The program can be used via a REPL such as IRB. For the moment, the simplest way is to copy and paste the contents of the bank_account.rb file into IRB.
